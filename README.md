# GigHub
## Skill Marketplace for College Students.

Our aim with this project is to create a user-friendly web platform where college students can effortlessly showcase their skills and connect with paid gig opportunities offered by startups and peers. By bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world application, we hope to empower students to earn income, build professional networks, and gain hands-on experience. Ultimately, this marketplace fosters an inclusive environment for both students seeking growth and organizations in need of fresh, innovative talent, driving meaningful collaboration and mutual success.
